# Personal Notes, Exercises and Materials from Stanford Android App Development
All materials are from my personal experience watching through the lectures and doing exercises, either describe during a lecture or from the website. 

Lectures can be found on youtube [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9e86ryplAsCGw4qxRU3xYD-n_T_XfnUr)

All Materials are found on the course website but are not downloadable due to login requirements. Do still check out the website it has a host of great content. [Link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193a/videos.shtml)


If your a non-Stanford learner you may also find Martijn Stegeman of the University of Amsterdam's open-courseware useful based on a mixture of Harvard and Stanford classes- CS50 and CS194a. Check it out at [Link](http://www.stgm.nl/courseware/)
